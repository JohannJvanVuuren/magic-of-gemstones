              Since the beginning of time, mankind have been held in the spell
              of the gems of the earth. In ancient time these stones were
              considered sacred and were integral in the domains of religion,
              medicine, protection and divinatory practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              From prehistoric times we have evidence of the Shiva Linghams,
              which were used as symbolic presentations of the god Shiva.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ancient Greek Pythagoreans believed that the sun was a giant
              crystal ball that gathered the light of the cosmos and reflected
              it back to the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gemstones have since time immemorial been thought of as the very
              bones of the earth and believed to carry the power of our life
              giving planet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our current theories revolves around the belief that they hold and
              transmute energy. It is this transmuted energy that interacts with
              the body, mind and soul of a living being.

              In this website I seek to offer a brief introduction not only to
              stones and their mystical properties, but also the ancient Chakra
              system to which the various stones have been mapped.
            </p>
            <p
              >It is this mapping of stones, their qualities and the
              corresponding Chakras, that form the basis of crystal healing as
              we know it today.
            </p>
            <p
              >There are numerous anecdotal accounts of the benefit of crystal
              therapy and healing, which have ensured a thriving industry around
              it.
            </p>
            <p
              >It is important to note, however, that the theories around
              gemstones and their mystical properties are intuitive and based on
              anecdotal evidence, and has not been subjected to empirical
              scientific investigation.

              Having said that, it still remains a part of our heritage as human
              beings and has been a source of inspiration and relief for many
              people.

        <h2>Sensual Magic</h2>
        <!-- Section with a quotation from a book used as source material (amongst others) for the content of the page  -->
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Crystals are a sensual and intuitive experience rather than an
            intellectual pursuit. They have a unique ability to absorb and
            transmute negative energy into beneficence - and to interact
            with us energetically. Their ability to harness the power of our
            mind is truly incredible - they amp up the energy , boosting
            whatever we do. And it's through handling them that we really
            connect to their magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've never worked with crystals before, you're in for
            a treat. These scrumptious beings pack a potent punch and you'll
            be amazed at the ways in which they enhance your life. Not merely
            decorative, they are protective and life-affirming too. They can
            increase your energy, enhance your well-being, help you to keep calm
            in a crisis, change the way you think, ensure your space is safe,
            offer you guidance and much else besides.
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin with, just pick up a Quartz crystal. Hold it lightly in
            your hand for a minute or two. Do you feel a tingling vibration or a
            pulsing in you hand? If so, you're experiencing the energy of
            the crystal.
          </p>
