# The Magic Of Gemstones

## 1. Introduction

This is a small website that introduces the visitor to the fascinating world of gemstones. It has a specifically esoteric focus on the meaning and use of stones in alternative holistic healing.

The website was created as a capstone portfolio project, forming part of the HyperionDev Immersive Full-Stack and Software Engineer Bootcamp. Its purpose was to showcase the cumulative skill in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript coding that has been built up towards the end of level 1 of the bootcamp. As the bootcamp progresses, the capstone projects are built upon to consolidate and incorporate new skills as they are required.
